On Saturday, December 1st, the iCons Alumni Network (iCAN) returned to the UMass campus to host this year’s annual “iCAN Get a Job” Event. We had a great turnout this year!

In an effort to provide current undergraduate students in the Program with some tips on how to apply for and secure their dream internship, post-grad job, or spot in graduate or medical school, alumni members offered a variety of different presentations.

Presentations included “how-to” guides for building great resumes and cover letters, suggestions on how to succeed in an interview, and details about applying for and making the most of medical or graduate school!

We also had an incredible presentation by guest speaker <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmitriy-fedorenko-60b06029/" target="_blank">Dmitriy Fedorenko</a> who spoke about his different experiences working at a small startup company and in big pharma.

Needless to say, this was an awesome event! Special thanks to all of the Alumni members and current iCons students who volunteered their time to helping out!
