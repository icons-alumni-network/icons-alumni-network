As part of an effort to give back to the campus community, eight members of the network travelled back to campus in December of 2016 to present the iCons Survival Guide.

The iCons Survival Guide is the first in a series of semesterly events. During the Fall, iCAN members will focus their efforts on providing value to current undergraduates by returning to campus and sharing advice on how to succeed academically and make the most of the program.

While the main objective of the event was academic in nature, another objective was to generate a sense of community among alumni by drawing them back to campus over shared experiences.

The event was divided into several sections. There were four alumni who each went over different aspects of the iCons program by sharing their personal experiences followed by a fifth and final section presented by current undergraduate, [Tim Nyazov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timurniyazov/){:target="_blank"}, who put everything into a contemporary context.
