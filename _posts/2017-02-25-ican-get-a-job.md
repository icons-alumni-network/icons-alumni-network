This February the network held its annual on-campus event focused on helping current iCons students get a head start on their careers. Nearly a dozen of our amazing alumni traveled back to Amherst for "ICAN Get a Job!"

Once our iCons Alumni overcame the elation in reconnecting with their classmates since graduation, they engaged the current cohorts on matters of career advancement. Alumni representatives were in attendance from UMass Medical
School, Harvard Graduate School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Dunkin’ Donuts,
Pratt and Whitney, KAYAK.com, Boston Children’s Hospital, Waters Corporation,
Meister Consultants Group, Oasys Water, Mercer, and UMass Department of
Biochemistry.

Biomedicine and energy undergraduates exchanged their resumes with
those that landed like-minded alumni in their current positions.

An industry and academia panel illuminated differences between the two avenues and offered tips for enhancing
cover letters, personal statements, and interview etiquette.

The satisfaction in giving back to a program that has provided so much to our alumni was augmented by unsolicited
acclaim from attendees:

> I just wanted to thank you for the iCAN Get a Job meeting! I found it really helpful and I'm glad there are alumni of iCons that want to forge connections with the current students. I would definitely be interested in keeping in touch and attending more events.

> I just wanted to thank all of you who organized the event and came out to campus on Saturday for iCAN Get a Job. I found it really helpful and hope there will be more events in the future. I am definitely going to convince other iCons members to come to the next event.
