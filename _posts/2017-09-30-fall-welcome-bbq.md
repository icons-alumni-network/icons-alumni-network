To welcome recent graduates of the iCons program to the Boston area, ICAN held its first Fall BBQ. A little bit of rain didn't stop us from having a great time!

Our amazing members turned out to be equally talented chefs. The food was fantastic, including some killer pulled pork prepared by [Isaac](https://www.facebook.com/isaac.han.12){:target="_blank"} and quacamole shrimp bites from [Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cavanaugh-73262880/){:target="_blank"}. [Olivia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliviarobertssano/){:target="_blank"} couldn't be there, but we made her famous coleslaw recipe.

Alumni ate, drank and networked into the evening, when we followed up all the food with cornbread and honey butter for dessert.
