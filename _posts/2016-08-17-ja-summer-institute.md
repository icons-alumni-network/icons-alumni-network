On August 17, the network partnered with [Junior Achievement of Northern New England](http://janewengland.org/){:target="_blank"} for a round robin workshop in which alumni engaged with high school students for meaningful conversations about how to prepare for and excel in college and life after college. Five alumni traveled to Northeastern University to give a presentation called "Evolution of Life: Leaving the Nest" as part of Junior Achievement's annual Summer Institute.

Junior Achievement (JA) is an organization that's been around for nearly 100 years. Their mission is to ignite the spark in young people to realize the opportunities and realities of work and life in the 21st century. Using hands-on experiences, JA helps to prepare young people for the real world by teaching skills in financial literacy, workforce readiness and entrepreneurship. JA Summer Institute is a week-long opportunity for 50 high school students to discover their entrepreneurial spirit, explore career options, learn about personal finance, network with business leaders, and collaborate with peers from different schools in Greater Boston.
