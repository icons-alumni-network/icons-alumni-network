On June 26 the network partnered with [Junior Achievement of Northern New England](https://www.juniorachievement.org/web/ja-usa/home){:target="_blank"} to teach fifth, sixth, and seventh grade classes for a day. Six alumni traveled to the [Eliot Innovation K-8 School](https://eliotk8school.org/){:target="_blank"} in Boston for "JA in a Day", a full-day program for students conducted in their regular school classrooms.

Isaac Han and [Olivia Roberts-Sano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliviarobertssano/){:target="_blank"} led the fifth grade with Our Nation, a curriculum focused on practical information about the need for skilled workers to meet the demands of the job market. Students were introduced to the concept of globalization of business and the need for entrepreneurial thinking to meet the demands of high-growth, high demand careers worldwide.

[Meaghan Molloy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meaghan-molloy-7311ba68/){:target="_blank"} and [Matt Richard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-richard-9b5a6862/){:target="_blank"} taught the sixth grade curriculum, It's My Business, which encouraged students to use critical thinking to learn entrepreneurial skills. Those skills include knowing customers' wants and needs, launching effective marketing, and creating detailed business plans. By examining the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, students learned that a belief in one's self can make positive things happen in life.

[Kevin Cavanaugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-cavanaugh-73262880/){:target="_blank"} and [Walter Fernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-fernandez-pereira-247014a8/){:target="_blank"} taught It's My Future to the seventh grade class. The lessons focused on preparing for the working world. Students learned about career clusters, high-growth jobs, career planning, and creating a personal brand. They demonstrated that in order to solve a problem, it takes collaboration from people with various backgrounds. 

The feedback received from the students and faculty affirmed our belief that our lessons had an impact on the students. 

> We are SO grateful for dedicated volunteers like you that make our programs successful and impactful for our students.  We heard wonderful reviews from the teachers and school leadership - THANK YOU!!!
